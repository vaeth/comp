comp - compare files or directories, including metadata

Author: Martin Väth <martin@mvath.de>

This project is under a BSD type license, meaning that you can do practically
everything with it except removing my name.

The command comp is similar to diff -r -q, but it compares also metadata like
symlinks, timestamps, permissions, partial content, etc.

You can specify in great detail which data actually will be compared
or ignored, whether symlinks will be followed, etc.

Use "comp --man" to get an extended help as a manpage.

This is a ground-up rewrite and redesign of the "comp-old" script
(originally called comp) from https://github.com/vaeth/mv_perl/

The script requires perl-5.12 or newer and some modules shipped with that
perl version. In addition, it is recommended to have the String::ShellQuote
module installed to get an improved output, though this is not mandatory.

To install this script, simply copy the content of bin/ to your $PATH.
To obtain zsh completion support, also put the content of zs/ into your $fpath.
(If you do not have root access, you can add the corresponding directory with
fpath+=("...")) before you call compdef from your zsh initialization files).

For installation under Gentoo, you can use the ebuild from the mv overlay
(which is available by layman).

Currrently, this script is in a first alpha phase, so some bugs can be expected
